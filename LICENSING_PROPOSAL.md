# Hormozi Advisor - Partnership Proposal

**Prepared for:** Alex Hormozi / Acquisition.com
**Prepared by:** Michael Kraft
**Date:** December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

I've built a complete software suite that brings your $100M Offers and $100M Leads frameworks to life as interactive tools. The product is production-ready, mobile-optimized, and generating organic interest from entrepreneurs and coaches.

This proposal outlines a partnership structure where you provide brand endorsement and distribution, while I handle all technical operations. The result: a new revenue stream for both parties with minimal effort on your end.

## Proposed Partnership Structure

### Revenue Share Model

| Party | Share | Responsibilities |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Michael Kraft** | 60% | Development, hosting, maintenance, support, updates |
| **Acquisition.com** | 40% | Brand licensing, promotion, distribution |

### Why This Split?

- **You (60%)**: All ongoing operational work, technical risk, infrastructure costs
- **Hormozi (40%)**: Brand value and audience access (significant but passive contribution)

This aligns incentives: I'm motivated to continuously improve the product because I benefit directly from its success.
